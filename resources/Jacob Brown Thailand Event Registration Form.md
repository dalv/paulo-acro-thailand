🗓️ Schedule & Descriptions

Saturday, Dec 13 | 10am–1pm
🌀 Washing Machines
Washing machines are circular Acro sequences where the flyer moves through spins, transitions, and inversions while the base lies on their back. They’re fun, accessible, and great for improving coordination, timing, and flow. Practicing washing machines expands your movement vocabulary, which strengthens all other areas of your Acro practice.

1:00–2:30pm Lunch

Saturday, Dec 13 | 2:30–5:30pm

🚀 Icarian
Icarian is popping but full release, meaning it is the most exciting type of acro by far. This is the kind of acro which feels the most like flying.

Sunday, Dec 14 | 10am–1pm
⚡ Whips & Whip Pops
Whips are a more difficult type of acrobatics requiring good timing and intelligent movement of feet. They always look impressive once mastered. Some are just whips and others are whips with a pop. We will help you wherever you are in your whip journey.

1:00–2:30pm Lunch

Sunday, Dec 14 | 2:30–5:30pm
💃 Dance Lifts
One sign of a well-rounded acrobat is the ability to put together a good acro dance routine. Jacob has scoured the internet plus the minds of other teachers to bring you all the best lifts. So what’s so cool about dance lifts? They tend to be more dynamic than standing poses, moving in and out rather than holding in a static pose. In this class we will teach you some lifts first and then later you will put these lifts into a sequence.
